First year notes
#################
The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive set of notes on the course material covered by the whole of the first year of the BSc Computer Science course at the University of Manchester.

The notes will be written in LaTeX due to its adaptability and extensive use of plain text files (which is good for VCS systems such as Git) among other things.
